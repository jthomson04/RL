# Managed Dynamo generation design

The managed Dynamo backend owns a fixed vLLM fleet inside the Ray allocation.
It is deliberately narrower than Dynamo itself: there is no external-runtime,
Kubernetes, DGD, or non-vLLM mode.

## Ownership and placement

Constructing `ManagedDynamoRuntime` is inert. Its explicit `start()` method
allocates ports, launches etcd and NATS JetStream, creates one Ray-managed
`dynamo.vllm` engine per model-parallel group, and starts the frontend. An
engine's world size is derived from vLLM tensor parallelism times pipeline
parallelism; expert parallelism must be either one or equal to tensor
parallelism. A multi-node engine has one normal process on node rank zero and
one headless vLLM process on every other node. Each node must hold the same
number of engine ranks.

Aggregated mode creates one homogeneous backend fleet from all inference GPU
groups. Disaggregated mode creates fixed decode and prefill pools. The pools
have independent replica counts but share TP, PP, EP, and all other vLLM
settings. Decode engines are ordered before prefill engines. This order is the
fixed engine order for placement, membership checks, metrics, and refit ranks.
Only the node-rank-zero process registers with Dynamo or exposes refit and
metrics endpoints.

Every P/D engine uses vLLM's `NixlConnector`. NeMo RL owns each engine's NIXL
host and side-channel port. Prefill engines also receive managed KV-event
configuration for the router. Dynamo disables these events when vLLM prefix
caching is disabled because there are no cached prefixes to reuse. Same-node
transfer can use CUDA transport. Cross-node transfer requires a working NIXL
UCX/RDMA path and is not qualified when it falls back to TCP.

Startup completes only after the frontend sees the same fixed membership at
the generation and RL endpoints for both the `backend` and `prefill`
components and advertises the configured model. Worker
handles are recorded before readiness checks so partial startup failures can
be torn down. Shutdown is idempotent and guards the frontend, worker pool,
NATS, etcd, and temporary state independently.

## Generation state

Both GRPO trainers use `DynamoGeneration.generate_async()` against the managed
frontend. NeMo-Gym traffic passes through a process-local token wrapper. It
uses the policy tokenizer, preserves caller `nvext.extra_fields`, adds Dynamo
engine metadata, and translates rendered multi-turn prefixes back to the exact
caller token IDs.

Serialized rollout copies contain only frontend URLs and immutable worker
admin endpoints. They cannot own or stop services. Those endpoints are enough
for AREAL-style post-refit cache invalidation; Magistral keeps its existing
driver-side invalidation lifecycle.

## Weight refit

Dynamo uses `CollectiveWeightSynchronizer`. If each engine has world size `E`,
worker `i` starts at rank `training_world_size + i * E`. In P/D mode, this
includes all decode engines followed by all prefill engines. The policy sender
uses vLLM's peer initialization and its fixed packed-transfer geometry: two
1-GiB buffers. The isolated vLLM environment validates the same constants
before a worker starts.

Generation is drained before refit. The worker then runs vLLM's native
`start_weight_update`, `update_weights`, and `finish_weight_update` transaction.
KV-cache invalidation stays outside the generic synchronizer because GRPO's
cache mode determines where it runs.

## Dependency isolation

`BUILD_DYNAMO=1` adds a Python 3.12 `/opt/dynamo_venv` to the standard image.
It contains only `ai-dynamo[vllm]==1.3.0.post1`, its pinned vLLM 0.23.0, etcd,
NATS, and its NIXL 1.1.0 CU13 dependency. NeMo-RL's normal Ray and engine
environments are unchanged; the standard NeMo-RL vLLM environment currently
uses vLLM 0.25.1.

vLLM 0.23.0 predates PR #44814, which fixes layerwise reload accounting for
composed loaders. The installer asserts the exact vLLM version, checks and
applies the backport, and records upstream merge commit
`c9e5bf813530fb9ce06024e075da0f520b0718c8` in
`/opt/dynamo_venv/VLLM_BACKPORTS`. Remove the backport only after Dynamo pins a
vLLM release containing that fix. At that point delete the patch, application
logic, marker assertion, and backport text rather than rebasing the patch.
