# Managed Dynamo generation on Slurm

NeMo RL can launch and own Dynamo's control plane, frontend, and a fixed vLLM
worker fleet inside a Slurm-backed Ray allocation. This mode supports direct
GRPO and NeMo-Gym rollouts, NCCL weight refits, cache invalidation, and
`generation_metrics/*` telemetry sent to enabled loggers such as W&B.
See the [Dynamo integration design](../design-docs/dynamo-integration.md) for
the service ownership, startup, and weight-refit architecture.

This integration is managed and vLLM-only. It does not connect to an external
Dynamo deployment and does not support Kubernetes, DGD, SGLang, TensorRT-LLM,
speculative decoding, or quantized generation.

## Build the image

The normal image is unchanged unless `BUILD_DYNAMO` is set:

```bash
docker buildx build \
  --build-context nemo-rl=. \
  --build-arg BUILD_DYNAMO=1 \
  --target release \
  --file docker/Dockerfile \
  --tag registry.example.com/nemo-rl:dynamo \
  .
```

The opt-in layer installs `ai-dynamo[vllm]==1.3.0.post1` in isolated Python
3.12 under `/opt/dynamo_venv`, along with etcd v3.5.21 and NATS Server v2.11.6.
It does not replace NeMo RL's normal Ray or vLLM dependencies: the standard
NeMo RL vLLM environment currently uses vLLM 0.25.1, while this isolated
Dynamo environment uses Dynamo's vLLM 0.23.0 pin. Both environments pin
`nvidia-nccl-cu13==2.30.7` so their NCCL communicators use the same release.
The Dynamo dependency set also contains `nixl-cu13==1.1.0` for prefill/decode
KV transfer.
For a local source checkout, the same environment can be installed under
`venvs/dynamo`:

```bash
bash docker/dynamo/install.sh
```

Set `NEMO_RL_DYNAMO_VENV_DIR` to choose another location. The installer checks
that Dynamo resolved vLLM 0.23.0, NCCL 2.30.7, and the NIXL 1.1.0 CU13 package.
It applies the vLLM PR #44814 backport only after `git apply --check` and writes
the upstream marker to `VLLM_BACKPORTS`.

Treat the isolated dependency pin and backport as one update. A Dynamo upgrade
must update and reverify these coupled locations:

- `docker/dynamo/pyproject.toml` and `docker/dynamo/uv.lock`: the Dynamo pin
  and resolved dependency set
- root `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`, plus the isolated Dynamo project and
  lockfile: the `nvidia-nccl-cu13` pins must remain identical
- `docker/dynamo/install.sh` and `tests/functional/grpo_dynamo.sh`: the vLLM
  version, backport marker, and runtime assertions
- `docker/dynamo/patches/vllm-0.23.0-layerwise-reload-composed-loader.patch`:
  the version-specific #44814 backport
- `tests/unit/distributed/test_stateless_process_group.py`: vLLM's
  `broadcast_from/0/0` weight-transfer wire key
- `nemo_rl/models/generation/dynamo/token_wrapper.py`: the real Dynamo response
  keys `nvext.engine_data.{prompt_token_ids,completion_token_ids,completion_logprobs}`;
  reverify them against real Dynamo output because unit tests validate only the
  expected local response shape
- `nemo_rl/models/generation/dynamo/managed_runtime.py`: the managed
  `DYN_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_PARSERS_V2=1` setting. Dynamo 1.3.0's legacy tool
  jail removes `nvext.engine_data`; remove this setting only after an upgraded
  Dynamo preserves the token metadata for `tool_choice=auto`
- this guide and the Dynamo design document: the stated versions and backport
  behavior

If the new Dynamo vLLM pin contains PR #44814, delete the patch file,
patch-application block, marker assertion, and explanatory backport text. Do
not rebase the patch onto the newer vLLM release.

## Configure Dynamo

Start with [`examples/configs/grpo_math_1B_dynamo.yaml`](../../examples/configs/grpo_math_1B_dynamo.yaml).
The important boundary is:

```yaml
policy:
  generation:
    backend: dynamo
    dynamo_cfg:
      engine: vllm
      disaggregation: null
      frontend_args:
        router_mode: kv
    vllm_cfg:
      tensor_parallel_size: 1
      pipeline_parallel_size: 1
      expert_parallel_size: 1
    colocated:
      enabled: false
      resources:
        gpus_per_node: 1
        num_nodes: 1
```

NeMo RL derives each engine's world size from TP times PP. EP must be one or
equal to TP. Parser settings belong under `dynamo_cfg.worker_args`; inherited
vLLM HTTP-parser settings are rejected with the corresponding Dynamo field.
Service ports and the namespace are runtime-owned rather than public config.

### Prefill/decode disaggregation

Use
[`examples/configs/grpo_math_1B_dynamo_disagg.yaml`](../../examples/configs/grpo_math_1B_dynamo_disagg.yaml)
for a small prefill/decode example. The opt-in fields are:

```yaml
policy:
  generation:
    dynamo_cfg:
      disaggregation:
        prefill_workers: 1
        decode_workers: 1
```

Both roles use the same `vllm_cfg` and `vllm_kwargs`. The required inference
GPU count is:

```text
(prefill_workers + decode_workers) * tensor_parallel_size * pipeline_parallel_size
```

Prefill and decode engines may be on different nodes. NeMo RL starts decode
engines first and then prefill engines. This gives every engine a stable NCCL
refit rank.

NeMo RL manages `--disaggregation-mode`, the NIXL connector, NIXL side-channel
ports, and prefill KV-event ports. Do not set these values in
`worker_args.extra_cli_args`, `vllm_kwargs`, or `vllm_cfg.env_vars`.
When vLLM prefix caching is disabled, Dynamo does not publish KV events because
there are no cached prefixes to reuse.

NIXL moves KV-cache data from prefill to decode. NCCL moves model weights from
training to every prefill and decode engine. Both roles receive each refit and
both roles have their KV caches cleared after the refit.

`vllm_cfg` settings are handled in five explicit classes:

| Class | Behavior | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Translated | Forwarded to `dynamo.vllm` | TP, PP, EP, dtype, model length |
| Moved | Startup error naming the Dynamo replacement | tool and reasoning parsers, HTTP serving chat kwargs |
| Unsupported | Warning when active, or an error when it requests unsupported low precision | tokenizer skipping, MX and mixed BF16/FP8 helpers |
| Managed runtime | Consumed or enforced by NeMo RL rather than forwarded | HTTP-wrapper enablement, metrics sampling, processed rollout logprobs |
| Inapplicable | Ignored because the managed path owns that behavior | async mode, progress bars, NeMo RL HTTP/ZMQ refit ports |

The shared GRPO base config also supplies `mcore_generation_config` and
`refit_cfg`. Dynamo accepts these inherited sections but does not use them;
worker arguments come from `vllm_cfg`, and refit uses the collective weight
synchronizer.

Enable and filter worker telemetry with both managed configuration sections:

```yaml
policy:
  generation:
    vllm_cfg:
      enable_vllm_metrics_logger: true
      vllm_metrics_logger_interval: 1.0
    dynamo_cfg:
      metrics_include_prefixes: null  # null selects the curated defaults
      metrics_exclude_prefixes: null  # null excludes python_ and process_
```

The NCCL sender also selects vLLM's peer protocol: the policy publishes both
the raw NeMo RL unique ID and vLLM's pickled `ncclUniqueId`, then uses the
all-reduce warmup expected by `PyNcclCommunicator`. This protocol choice and
the packed 1-GiB/two-buffer geometry come from the generation backend rather
than GRPO-specific branches.

The fixed port layout is:

- `1313-1399`: driver-local etcd and NATS control plane
- `1400-1999`: cross-node vLLM multiprocessing rendezvous by default
- `3000-3999`: frontend and token-wrapper HTTP endpoints
- `4000-4099`: node-local `DYN_SYSTEM_PORT`
- `4100-4199`: node-local NIXL side-channel ports
- `4200-4299`: node-local prefill KV-event ports
- `7000 + slot * 100`: node-local vLLM rendezvous ports

### Multi-node engine groups

Set TP times PP larger than the inference GPUs reserved per node. NeMo RL uses
the same topology-ordered unified placement as the native vLLM backend. Node
rank zero runs the normal Dynamo engine, and each other node runs a headless
vLLM process. No additional Dynamo configuration is required.

This example creates one TP2 aggregate engine across two nodes with one
inference GPU on each node:

```yaml
policy:
  generation:
    vllm_cfg:
      tensor_parallel_size: 2
      pipeline_parallel_size: 1
      expert_parallel_size: 1
    colocated:
      enabled: false
      resources:
        gpus_per_node: 1
        num_nodes: 2
```

Each engine must have the same number of reserved ranks on every participating
node. For one TP2 prefill engine and one TP2 decode engine, keep
`gpus_per_node: 1`, set `num_nodes: 4`, and set both disaggregation worker
counts to one. Cross-node TP and PP need a fast NCCL transport. P/D also needs
the existing NIXL UCX/RDMA path.

## Run the two-GPU smoke

Convert the image to the format required by the Slurm site, then submit from
the repository root:

```bash
export CONTAINER=/shared/images/nemo-rl-dynamo.sqsh
export MOUNTS="$PWD:$PWD"
export GPUS_PER_NODE=2
export BASE_LOG_DIR="$PWD/results/dynamo-smoke/logs"
printf -v COMMAND '%q ' \
  /opt/nemo_rl_venv/bin/python -u "$PWD/examples/run_grpo.py" \
  --config "$PWD/examples/configs/grpo_math_1B_dynamo.yaml"
export COMMAND

sbatch \
  --nodes=1 \
  --gres=gpu:2 \
  --exclusive \
  --account=<account> \
  --partition=<partition> \
  ray.sub
```

The recipe assigns one GPU to training and one to a TP1 Dynamo worker. Its two
steps exercise generation, refit, post-refit cache invalidation, telemetry,
and cleanup. For a matched control, run the same seed/model/batch settings with
the standard non-colocated vLLM backend and compare post-refit output validity.

## Run the three-GPU disaggregated smoke

Use the same command with three GPUs and the P/D config:

```bash
export GPUS_PER_NODE=3
printf -v COMMAND '%q ' \
  /opt/nemo_rl_venv/bin/python -u "$PWD/examples/run_grpo.py" \
  --config "$PWD/examples/configs/grpo_math_1B_dynamo_disagg.yaml"
export COMMAND

sbatch \
  --nodes=1 \
  --gres=gpu:3 \
  --exclusive \
  --account=<account> \
  --partition=<partition> \
  ray.sub
```

This assigns one GPU to training, one to a TP1 decode engine, and one to a TP1
prefill engine. The existing Dynamo L1 job runs both the aggregated and P/D
smokes. These tests verify function only. They do not measure or claim
performance.

## Run SWE1 with W&B

The three-node nightly recipe targets
`nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B-BF16`. It uses two 8-GPU training
nodes and one 8-GPU inference node. The inference node runs two TP4/EP4 Dynamo
engines. Download the standard SWE1 split under
`${HF_HOME}/superv3_data/swe1`, then run the registered test-suite driver:

```bash
HF_HOME=/shared/huggingface \
WANDB_API_KEY=<key> \
bash tests/test_suites/llm/grpo-nanov3-30ba3b-3n8g-megatron-dynamo-swe1.sh
```

A successful acceptance run completes four training steps, produces valid
generations after refit, and records worker timelines under
`generation_metrics/*` in TensorBoard and W&B.

## Operational notes

- The driver owns all services. Do not start a separate etcd, NATS, frontend,
  or worker fleet for this mode.
- Startup validates fixed worker membership; a dead or replaced worker fails
  refit instead of serving mixed model versions.
- Shutdown is idempotent and terminates whole subprocess groups, including
  partial-startup failures.
- Fault tolerance and a multi-controller architecture remain follow-up work.
