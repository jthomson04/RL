    Two ways to specify the frontend, mutually exclusive:

    * ``dgd_name`` — friendly path. The class derives
      ``http://{dgd_name}-frontend.{namespace}.svc.cluster.local:{frontend_port}/v1``
      from the dynamo operator's stable Service naming convention. Requires
      running inside the Kubernetes pod that has cluster-DNS access. nrl-k8s
      stamps this field automatically when it brings up the DGD.

    * ``frontend_url`` — escape hatch. Any reachable HTTP URL. Use this when
      pointing at a hand-rolled DGD with a non-default Service name, an
      external cluster reached via NodePort/Ingress, or running outside
      Kubernetes entirely. Setting this disables the K8s in-pod check.

    Exactly one of the two must be set. ``frontend_url`` wins if both are.
