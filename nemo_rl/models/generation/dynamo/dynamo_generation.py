"""Dynamo backend for nemo-rl: a thin URL forwarder to a DynamoGraphDeployment.

On Kubernetes, a ``DynamoGraphDeployment`` (DGD) owns the entire inference
stack — etcd, NATS, the dynamo frontend, and the vLLM/sglang/trtllm workers.
This class does not bring any of that up; it only resolves the cluster-internal
URL of the DGD's frontend Service so nemo-gym can dispatch rollout requests to
it over HTTP.

      3. Re-discover via /health. If new instance_ids appeared (a worker
         scaled in or restarted during the cycle), go to step 2.

    Workers that DISAPPEARED mid-cycle (instance_id no longer in /health)

        After the trainer has published the new weight version to the MX
        server (via ``policy.stream_weights_via_mx``), call the Dynamo
        Endpoint ``{namespace}.{component}.update_weights_via_mx`` on each
        worker. The handler at ``BaseWorkerHandler.update_weights_via_mx``
        fans into ``AsyncLLM.collective_rpc("update_weights_via_mx", …)``
        which runs the real NIXL receive synchronously inside every vLLM
        worker process; the endpoint streams back one JSON object whose
        ``status`` field tells us whether the receive succeeded.

        Returns a list of Ray ObjectRefs (one per worker). The caller
        ``ray.get(...)`` raises if any worker reported a non-ok status,
        producing a loud failure if the publish was invisible or the
        receive errored — replaces the silent stale-weight failure mode
        of the prior poll-only architecture.
