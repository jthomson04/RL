"""ModelExpress v2 refit receiver, as a vLLM v1 ``worker_extension_cls``.

Registered into the vLLM ``Worker`` class via ``parallel_config.worker_extension_cls``
so its methods become callable through ``AsyncLLM.collective_rpc``. Each method
runs **inside the worker process**, where ``self.model_runner.model`` and
``self.device`` are available.

Lifetime model (mirrors ``VllmInternalWorkerExtension``):

  * ``prepare_refit_info(state_dict_info)`` is called once per worker before the
    first refit. Stores per-tensor (shape, dtype) for asserts and FP8 paths.
  * ``update_weights_via_mx(version, mx_config)`` is called every refit cycle.
    Lazy-initializes an :class:`modelexpress.MxV2RefitReceiver` on first call,
    registers ``model.named_parameters()`` as NIXL receive buffers, then for
    every subsequent cycle: discover same-rank source → RDMA receive → call
    ``_load_weights`` → optionally republish as inference_replica for tree
    fan-out.

The Dynamo handler in ``components/src/dynamo/vllm/handlers.py`` invokes this
via ``await self.engine_client.collective_rpc("update_weights_via_mx", kwargs=...)``.

        fused-layout bug we hit on 2026-07-03 lives there), we resolve
        each received HF tensor to exactly ONE of three destinations,
        computed ONCE. This is our own eager, destination-mapped
        in-place write — inspired by RDT's "don't re-run the loader
        each refit" goal, but NOT RDT: no lazy tensors, no deferred
        narrow(), no dependency on the RDT API. We eagerly RDMA-pull
        then copy into the params' final slots, because NeMo-RL already
        knows its target layout (declared TargetTpLayout) so the dynamic
        layout discovery RDT's laziness buys is unnecessary here.

          * ``direct``  — ``hf_name`` matches a vLLM param 1:1 by shape.

            (q/k/v -> qkv_proj, gate/up -> gate_up_proj). Warm cycle
            does ``param.data.narrow(0, offset, size).copy_(tensor)``.
            Offsets are derived from the ACTUAL member tensor shapes
            (not model config), so this is version-robust: whatever
            order/size vLLM allocated, we match it by summing member
            rows in canonical (q,k,v / gate,up) order.
          * ``expert``  — per-expert MoE tensor (gate/up/down_proj)
            resolved via vLLM's ``get_expert_mapping()`` to a slot in
            the stacked ``w13_weight`` / ``w2_weight`` param. Warm cycle

            (``--moe-backend triton``); the swizzled 4D ``auto`` layout
            routes to fallback (and the swizzle guard errors first).

            swizzled backend. Warm cycle routes these through vLLM's
            stock loader. On dense + triton-MoE this set is EMPTY.

        Megatron-Core trainers publish per-rank native shards (no allgather)
        — column-parallel rows / row-parallel cols / fused QKV / fused
        gated-MLP / per-expert grouped tensors / etc. The receiver-side
        translator (``modelexpress.megatron_translator``) assembles those
        shards into HF-shaped tensors via vendored Bridge helpers,
        without taking a Bridge dependency in this worker image.

        Two paths depending on the trainer's TP layout:

          * **matched-TP** (source_tp == target_tp): one source per
            tp_rank; bulk receive_from into pre-allocated dest buffers
            registered with NIXL; translator walks the filled buffers
            directly (no host-side assembly).

          * **mixed-TP** (source_tp != target_tp): per-source sliced
            pull. Each plan's per-source contribution lands directly in
            the planner's pre-narrowed dest view via the v1
            ``MxRefitReceiver.pull_to`` primitive (one combined NIXL
            transfer with N descriptor pairs per source). Row-parallel
            (axis-1 narrows, non-contiguous in memory) falls back to
            v0 scratch + host copy.

        Cluster-validated:
          * Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507 matched-TP: 398 / 398 byte-identical
